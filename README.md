### Reflections and Comments

Q: How do you think your prior life and professional experience will help you in this new endevour?

A: Two years before coming to Code Fellows, I had the opportunity of taking my first programming classes in Python and R.

it was pretty hard to even learned the basics of both programming languages, but after taking those courses; I started supplementing my education with Udemy courses.

Taking these courses taught me that programming is a skill that everyone can learn.

Little bu little, I started to learn more and new things.

These experiences, allowed me to explore a new field (Data Science).

Two years after taking my first programming class, I was able to learn data science, implement machine learning algorithms with Python, lead technical fields at Bridging Tech, and it allowed me to come to Code Fellows with hunger to learn a new stack.

i think that the experience of transfering to university as a sophmore (not knowing much about programming), and taking data science at my university and udemy courses online - gave me the confidence that I needed to come to Code Fellows to learn a new stack and a new branch of computer science.
